		    rdbe - RDBE low level communication.

            Syntax:     rdbeX=<InString>

            Response:   rdbeX/<OutString>


Settable parameters:
        X           letter: 'a','b', 'c', 'd', or null for all active RDBEs
        <InString>  string to be sent RDBE(s). If the string does not end
                    with a semi-colon ";", one will be added.

Monitor-only parameters:
        <OutString> resulting ouput from RDBE X

Comments:
Like all commands that start with "rdbe", this command can either
operate on an individual RDBE if the letter for that RDBE is appended
to the command, or all active RDBEs if no letter is appended.  The
response always includes the letter of the RDBE the response came
from.  Active RDBEs are defined by the "active_rdbes" command.  At
start-up all configured RDBEs are considered active.
