		    mk6 - Mark6 low level communication.

            Syntax:     mk6X=<InString>

            Response:   mk6X/<OutString>


Settable parameters:
        X           letter: 'a', 'b', or null for all active Mark6s
        <InString>  string to be sent to Mark6(s). If the string does not end
                    with a semi-colon ";", one will be added.

Monitor-only parameters:
        <OutString> resulting ouput from Mark6 X

Comments:
Like all commands that start with "mk6", this command can either
operate on an individual Mark6 if the letter for that Mark6 is
appended to the command, or all active Mark6s if no letter is
appended.  The response always includes the letter of the Mark6 the
response came from.  Active Mark6s are defined by the "active_mk6s"
command (yet to be implemented).  At start-up all configured Mark6s
are considered active.
