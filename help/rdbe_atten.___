		    rdbe_atten - RDBE attenuation

            Syntax:     rdbe_attenX=<value0>,<value1>

            Response:   rdbe_attenX/<value0>,<value1>


Settable parameters:
        X          letter: 'a','b', 'c', 'd', or null for all active RDBEs
        <value0>   attenutation value for IF0, 0-31.5 in 0.5 steps, or "auto"
                   when commanding to cause the RDBE(s) to automatically
                   adjust the level to get a raw sample RMS of 32, a null
                   value when commanding means to not set the attenuation
        <value1>   attenutation value for IF1, 0-31.5 in 0.5 steps, or "auto"
                   when commanding to cause the RDBE(s) to automatically
                   adjust the level to get a raw sample RMS of 32, a null
                   value when commanding means to not set the attenuation


Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments:
Like all commands that start with "rdbe", this command can either
operate on an individual RDBE if the letter for that RDBE is appended
to the command, or all active RDBEs if no letter is appended.  The
response always includes the letter of the RDBE the response came
from.  Active RDBEs are defined by the "active_rdbes" command.  At
start-up all configured RDBEs are considered active.
